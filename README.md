# PEC ASP Implementation

The Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a probabilistic extension of a popular framework for reasoning about the effects of a narrative of action occurrences (events) along a time line known as the [Event Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_calculus) (EC).

This repository hosts an [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming) Implementation of PEC able to perform temporal projection.
